# 🛒 E-Commerce Website

This is a responsive front-end e-commerce website built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, designed to simulate an online shopping experience. The project features a homepage with product listings, a product detail layout, and a static shopping cart page. It uses **Flexbox** and **Grid** for layout design, **Font Awesome** for icons, **Google Fonts** for typography, and **media queries** to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. While the site is static with no backend functionality, it serves as a strong foundation for building a fully functional e-commerce platform.
